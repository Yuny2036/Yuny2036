🙋🏻‍♀️ Greetings, visitor! 🙋🏻‍♀️  
You're now seeing Han Seung-woo's profile.  
But, I prefer calling myself 'Yuny' or **'Younhee'**.

## What do you get paid to do? 💰
Currently working on :: No job..  

😭 I, sadly, working on nowhere. 😭  
Yes. As you know, we're all having a hard time, right? 🚬  
World-wide depression, wars, economical fears, job-market shifting within AI rush(!)..  

However, I have no doubt of that we can go through these things! 👍  
We all just need some time.  


## So, what are you doing right now? 👀
Currently doing :: Learning some codes in school.

To me, the most difficult thing on programming/design is 'pulling out an idea from my head'.  
🤦🏻‍♀️ I'm struggling with my brain, type-speed and laziness. 🤦🏻‍♀️  


## What will you do/upload on your repos? 🤔
I think various things will be uploaded here.  
😈 Yes, literally VARIOUS things. 😈  

All I'm worrying about is my laziness..
